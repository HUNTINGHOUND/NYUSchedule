# NYU Schedule
A web app that crawls the albert public course search website to get easily gather course information. It's built with a calendar that students can use to better visualize their schedule.

## Demo
The application is currently hosted on [github pages](https://huntinghound.github.io/nyuschedule/).

## Build it yourself?
Clone this repo, go to the root directory and run `npm install` (if this fails try to delete `package-lock.json` and/or update npm). Once all the dependencies are installed, run `npm start` to serve the application on your local network.

## Back-End Server
The back end server used for this app is maintained at another repo [here](https://github.com/HUNTINGHOUND/albertserver).

## TODOS
- [ ] Better Styling for the calendar through css and custom components
- [ ] Complete keyword filter option (keyword option does nothing at the time of writing)
- [ ] More filter options
- [ ] Use local storage to save options
- [ ] Backend unit-testing
- [ ] Frontend unit-testing
- [ ] Documentation of the code
- [ ] Login feature? (TBD)
